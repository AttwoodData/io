## Conclusion
# From our sensitivity analysis, we conclude that under various conditions we can 
# expect an increase in net benefits between $339,000 to $952,000 with an "average" 
# expected increase of $691,000. Also of note is that some benefits accrue regardless 
# of CO2 emission considerations.
#
# As a result, it is recommended that the City of Kirkwood adopt a policy of transitioning 
# its light and medium vehicles to electric versions in pursuit of its underlying goal 
# to mitigate climate change through targeted environmental initiatives.
